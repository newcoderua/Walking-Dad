atom ## Walking Dad is educational web app for young coders inspired by [CodeMonkey](https://www.playcodemonkey.com/)

Walking dad is fun a online game that teaches you how to code. Couple first challenges you will get hints but then you will have to think how to solve the problems. It is a one-player game.


The screen would be divided into two parts: left one for coding and right one for rendering stuff.

This game will be consist of 10 levels. From easiest to hardest.

Dad is main character of the game. He will be walking around the room and gathering kids toys to stop kid crying.
User will navigate Dad by typing in easy commands(like turn left, walk 10 steps, turn around etc.)

### Functionality & MVP

With this game User will be able to:

- Start, reset round, ask for hint
- Go to the previuos challenge
- Get scores depending on performance


### Wireframes

This app will consist of multiple pages. Since the screen will be divided into two parts, layout on the left side will be changing depending on the current level. And also it will be navlinks to github, Linkedin and modal about the project. On the right side of the screen will be input textarea for code, button to run code and button to reset.
